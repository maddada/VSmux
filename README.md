## This extension is for you if:

- You like to code using multiple agent CLIs in parallel.
- You don't want to be locked into a tool like conductor or superset or w/e.
- You don't want to be missing out on the new features that are coming to the CLIs first.
- You also love to be close to the code for some projects and review changes in your favorite editor (VS Code/Cursor/Antigravity/etc.)
- Like to use VS Code to edit the md files and prompts (ctrl+g) before sending them to the agent cli.

Then this is the extension for you! You get a very nice interface to work with your agents without having to jump between the editor and the ADE tool.

> Inspired by Antigravity agent panel, Codex app, T3Code, CMux, and Superset + many more.

## Highly recommended VS Code Setup to work with worktrees and parallel agents

### 1. Enable Native Tabs

If you are on macOS, turn on VS Code's `window.nativeTabs` setting.

This makes it much easier to switch between projects, repos, and worktrees because each VS Code window can live in the same native tab strip. Instead of juggling separate windows, you can keep multiple VSmux workspaces open and move between them quickly with the normal macOS tab workflow.

### 2. Turn On Repositories Explorer for Worktrees

Enable `SCM > Repositories: Explorer`, and make sure `SCM > Repositories: Selection Mode` is set to `single`.

This exposes repository artifacts directly inside the Source Control UI, including branches, stashes, tags, and worktrees. It makes creating and managing Git worktrees much easier from the VS Code UI, without needing to drop into the terminal for every worktree action.

### 3. Set your $Editor in ~/.zshrc to your editor (code/cursor/etc.)

This lets you write your prompt inside your editor instead strugling with the annoying input box that these AI tools provide.
No more [50 lines pasted] nonsense. Paste all the lines you want and even select parts of them and use inline AI to edit those.

## Companion App

VSmux works great with my other tool that shows all running agent sessions in a mini floating bar on macOS (with running/waiting/done indicators). Check it out here: https://github.com/maddada/agent-manager-x

## Contributions welcome 🙏🏻

## Getting Started

1. Open the Command Palette.
2. Run `VSmux: Open Workspace`.
3. Create your first session.
4. Use the sidebar and hotkeys to change the visible split count and jump between sessions and groups.

## Settings

- `VSmux.backgroundSessionTimeoutMinutes`: controls how long detached background sessions stay alive after the last VSmux window disconnects
- `VSmux.sidebarTheme`: changes the sidebar theme preset
- `VSmux.showCloseButtonOnSessionCards`: shows or hides the close button on session cards
- `VSmux.sendRenameCommandOnSidebarRename`: stages `/rename <new name>` in the terminal when you rename from the sidebar

## Local T3 Embed Setup

The T3 embed frontend is intentionally local-only and gitignored.

Use the dedicated update/setup guide here:

- [docs/2026-04-03-how-to-update-t3-code.md](/Users/madda/dev/_active/agent-tiler/docs/2026-04-03-how-to-update-t3-code.md)

That document is the current source of truth for:

- refreshing the vendored `t3code` version from upstream `main`
- rebuilding the local embed bundle
- testing the update safely in a separate worktree
- avoiding the protocol/runtime issues that broke earlier attempts

## Features

### Session Management

- **Create, rename, and close** terminal sessions from the sidebar
- **Session groups** — organize sessions into up to 4 named groups, rename groups, and drag sessions between them
- **Drag-and-drop reordering** — reorder sessions within and across groups, reorder command buttons
- **Session aliases** — each session gets an auto-generated word alias (Atlas, Beacon, Comet, etc.)
- **Previous session history** — closed sessions are archived (up to 200) and can be browsed or restored from a modal

### Layout & Views

- **Configurable visible count** — show 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 9 sessions at once
- **Session slot hotkeys** — jump to any session slot with Cmd+Alt+1–9
- **Group focus hotkeys** — switch between groups with Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1–4
- **Directional focus navigation** — move focus up/right/down/left across sessions with Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Arrow keys
- **Split count hotkeys** — set 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 9 visible splits with the Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+S chord

### Agent Launchers

- **Built-in agent buttons** — one-click launch for T3 Code, Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, and Gemini
- **Custom agents** — add your own agent launchers with custom commands and names
- **Agent icon detection** — session cards show the agent logo watermark based on what's running
- **Edit and delete agents** — right-click context menu on agent buttons

### Command Shortcuts

- **Sidebar command buttons** — quick-launch buttons for Dev, Build, Test, Setup (or your own)
- **Custom commands** — create commands with a name, shell command, and optional close-on-exit behavior
- **Drag-and-drop reordering** — reorder command buttons in the sidebar
- **Edit and delete commands** — right-click context menu on command buttons

### Activity Tracking

- **Three activity states** — idle, working, and attention indicators on session cards
- **Claude Code title detection** — automatically detects Claude Code idle/working state from terminal title
- **Shell integration** — detects agent start/stop lifecycle events via control sequences
- **Codex log pattern matching** — parses Codex CLI log output for task_started/task_complete events

- **10 completion sounds** — Arcade, African, Afrobeat, EDM, Come Back To The Code, Glass, Ping, Shamisen, Superset Doo-Wap, Superset Quick

### T3 Code Integration

- **Embedded T3 sessions** — T3 Code runs directly inside the VSmux sidebar as a webview
- **T3 activity monitoring** — WebSocket connection to local T3 runtime tracks thread activity in real time
- **T3 session lifecycle** — automatic supervision, sync, and management of T3 sessions

### Theming

- **11 sidebar theme presets** — Auto, Plain, Dark Green/Blue/Red/Pink/Orange, Light Blue/Green/Pink/Orange
